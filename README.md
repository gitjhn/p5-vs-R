# p5-vs-R
Processing vs Raphael experiment for HTML5 canvas using javascript.

Simple experiments trying to work with curve paths and a SVG path to style text and graphics.

The p5 example is more limited because it lacked the more feature rich svg path functionality of Raphael.

The Raphael example was built using a similar structure pattern to how p5 examples are built for easier understanding between the two files.

#Depends on the following libraries:

  * Processing - p5.js - http://p5js.org/
  * Raphael - raphael.js - http://raphaeljs.com/

#Running Locally
